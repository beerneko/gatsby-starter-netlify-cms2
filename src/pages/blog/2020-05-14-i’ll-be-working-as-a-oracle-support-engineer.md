## I always wanted to work in a team...



I know my biggest strength is make the development goal come true. However I am always Interested in working as a team member with my trustworthy teammates and learn from them. Age? Oh, it doesn’t matter! Only I’m afraid of being a stinky prep to the others.

One day, some direct company recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn. As soon as I saw it’s not from agent And this company has really huge name, I replied him.

He provided me a telephone interview next day, and he set the all schedule for me while this “Pandemic” caos by only using email.

I had the total one Telephone interview and two Zoom interviews. Somehow, I was super comfortable to tell them what I have done and what I think. I still remember especially the one that I was asked why I need to start working in the age 50. I told them that I neede to quit my Supreme Court IT position because of my husband’s job, and I disparately feel behind from everything. Then the interviewer asked me what exactly I’m behind of, and I said “Technology”...

I know C# enough to make a Systematic Memorable app, “OBOERO” and I used to make a state governments web applications. A tons...

Still it never fill up my satisfaction of being IT Profession.

Oh, well. My point is what I’m facing is the endless path. As long as you want to believe in what you can, yes you can. It’s also the endless believe.

Please girls, keep learning and believe what you can be the one you want to be.
