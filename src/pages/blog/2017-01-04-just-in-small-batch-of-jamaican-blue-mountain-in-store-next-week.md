Sorry if you have hard time understanding my words. But it's a good measurement for you to judge my English skills!

## Why is that so important to record what you learn?

Because the human brain is not so trustworthy.

You probably feel right when you finished learning and comprehending. However, that is the moment of the time your memory just started going downhill. 

I have a lot of confidence in my knowledge of computer software development since 1999. Those are the knowledge that I put in my whole passion and efforts over the years and years. Also, I used to so good at the runtime debugging the existing old RPG codes, but it not anymore. Why? Because I don't use AS400 for more than 2 years and probably legacy AS400 RPG is not a hot topic in the current computer world any more neither. And guess what, I'm still getting AS400 job interview offers from the outside of the Texas state where I live! They are expecting me to relocate for the position! (I could have done that if I'm single and don't have kids...)

To me, experiences that I can list up in my resume should be the ones that I can still bring a memory back without requiring time and expensive overlapped training.

So I decided to keep learning and recording what I learn before forget them!
