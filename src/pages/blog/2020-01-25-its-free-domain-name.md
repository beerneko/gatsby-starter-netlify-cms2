  Do you really care that you use your own unique domain name only? Can't you

## **BEERNEKO will make your website from $100!**

BEERNEKO uses Netlify domain which is exactly like this website you are reading and it's totally free. It is for you to be able to know how it looks like and what you can do with it. 



**Domain name:**

 **FREE**: A unique name like "nekonya"  to be used as your original domain name will be "https://nekonya.netlify.com".

**CUSTOM**: I'll cost and you need to maintain the payment by yourself. Please check from this website (https://instantdomainsearch.com/). The price will be shown by your choosing name. BEERNEKO helps you to purchase and add it after you purchase it.



\*In the future if your use will be exceeded, you need to switch to paid accounts. 

Please make sure about the "Number of sites" and the free plan requirements as below. Mostly small businesses and personal use only, it is hardly reached the limit as long as cleaning old posts. However, this is not a guaranteed statement because of your future use. It just likes how much a coffee lover drinks coffee in a day.
