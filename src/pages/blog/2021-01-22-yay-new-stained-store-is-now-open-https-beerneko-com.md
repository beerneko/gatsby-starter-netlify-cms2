  My new business just has begun. I'm still a pretty much struggling learner,
  but if I don't start anything with my accumulated knowledge made out of my
  efforts, nothing would start! 

  My new knowledge is:


  "Stained Glass"


  I'll make it really cheap. But I learning as many as I get orders from
  customers. 

  I heard a lot about there are so many fake stained glasses that are made of
  vinyl and factory-made, but they are still over $200 to $300. 

  Yes, I'll make the same but listen to you and make your original with real
  glass sheets!
