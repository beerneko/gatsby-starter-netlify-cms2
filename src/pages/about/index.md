### Beerneko is a hard worker!

System Engineer in AS/400, PHP, Java, Javascript at both the USA and Japan. Recently becoming certified MCSA in Microsoft SQL 2016 Database Development.

I have over 7 years of working experience at the Nebraska State Government includes Nebraska Supreme court, and have more independent contracts in Google Apps Script, Visual Basic, WordPress, and other various computer languages in the past 17 years.

As a personal note, in 2019, I needed to go back and forth between the United State and Japan to act as a caregiver to a sick family member in Japan. During that time, I really found my passion for studying new technologies and working as a freelance, which is why I'm so excited about reopening my new IT carrier.

<!-- ### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog. -->
